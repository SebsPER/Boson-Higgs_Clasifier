# Boson-Higgs-Classifier
In this project the aim is to compare three different models (Naive-Bayes, Decision Tree and a Neural Network) to see which one has the most accuracy. This project was inspired by a Kaggle dataset which is linked in the paper. The paper is in Spanish as it is my first language.
